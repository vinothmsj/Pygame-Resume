1. The aim to display the content of resume as a slide on pygame screen
2. Have divided the resuem content into 7  parts.
3. py_res.py which captures the data from json file 
4. Then from run_this.py we being by intitliasing the pygame and setting the suraface and buttons on the page.
5. Function calls respective the page number quieried based on forward and backward button.
6. So depending the button pressed the we need to call the respective pages. 
7. The data displayed on the page is from the run_this file, which is already set based on json input.
After the initial calls, repetitive function calls are made to navigate over the pages.

However the content in the json is limited as the text formatiing in pygame need to implemented.
Will make that in the next commit.
